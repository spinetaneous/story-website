  <p>Born in a small cozy Californian suburb, Elizabeth is an 8 year old girl who enjoys taking care of plants. Her plant collection currently contains over 10 different types of plants, from small succulents and petite bonsai trees to towering bamboo stalks and tall tomato plants. She enjoys reading on the weekends. Her current problem is that people seem to think that she owns a big red dog.</p>
