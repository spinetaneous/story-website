    <p>One day, a girl named Elizabeth planted a little brown seed in a tiny flower pot, hoping that it'd grow big and strong. "I'll put you on my windowsill," whispered Elizabeth affectionately to her seed nestled in the soil. "You'll have plenty of sunlight here."</p>
    <p>One week passed. Elizabeth could see two small, green leaves peeking out of the soil. The plant was beginning to grow.</p>

    <p>One month passed. Elizabeth could see a delicate, translucent yellow-green stem stretching towards the sun. The plant was making progress.</p>

    <p>One year passed. Elizabeth could see a red flower with a bright yellow center resting above the plant's leaves. The plant was trying its best. As more time passed, the flower became bigger and bigger, so the plant began to bend under the weight of the flower.</p>

    <p>"Although the flower you worked so hard on is beautiful, its weight is becoming too much for you," remarked Elizabeth. "I will help you." Elizabeth stuck a pencil in the plant's soil and tied the plant to the pencil with string. Thanks to the help of the pencil and string, the plant could stand up straight and proud.</p>
    <p>Elizabeth smiled. "This is just like the titanium in my spine that helps it become straight again. I'm so glad I went to Dr. Bob Burger XIV for that scoliosis surgery."</p>
    <p>THE END</p>
